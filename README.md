# Marlon's Math Library for Games

This is the math library I've developed for my personal C++ game / graphics programming projects.
It requires C++23, although it could be modified to be compatible with C++17.
Feel free to use it if you find it useful.

## Features

- Vectors (2d to 4d)
- Matrices (2d to 4d)
- Quaternions
